**This is a personnal project, please quote this repository if reusing the code.**

## What does this do ?
This project generates random data visualizations, out of a series of prepared data sets, and tweets them on the [@datavizBot](https://twitter.com/datavizBot) Twitter account with a legend and several tags matching the content of the image.

## Recommendations :
- Installing `plotly` and `tweepy` in the environment is necessary for the script to run. See `requirements.txt`.
- To access `.csv` files, see [datavizBot_collectingdata repository](https://github.com/alix-tz/datavizBot_collectingdata)
